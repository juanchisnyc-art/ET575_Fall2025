Was the code correct? (Yes/No): Yes
Was it readable and properly commented?: Yes
Were you able to explain each line of code?: yes
Did it use the same programming concepts we learned in class?:

Terminal Output:---- Example 1: string indexing [] ----
first_name = Juan
The 3rd character (index 2) = a

---- Example 2: .at() and .length() ----
The 1st character using .at(0) = J
There are 4 character(s) in Juan

---- Example 3: concatenation with + ----
Concatenated: Juan Velasco - JV123

---- Example 4: substr(start, length) ----
Original: Today is a beautiful day!
msg.substr(2, 5) = day i
